# AirBnB_clone
## Description of project
This is a simple clone of the AirBnB website using Python, done in partners, covering
the fundamentals of the higher level programming track.
This will culminate into a complete web application comprised of 4 parts:
- A website (call front-end) that shows the final product to everybody
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

## Description of command interpreter 
### How to start it
The command interpreter works in both interactive and non-interactive mode. Run the command interpreter by executing `./console.py`.
### How to use it
The following commands have been implemented:
| Command  | Syntax                        |Definition                                    |  
|:-------: | ------------------------------|----------------|  
| `help`   |`help [command]`               |to get help about other commands.             |  
| `quit`   |`quit`                         |or `EOF` (end of file) to terminate session.  |
